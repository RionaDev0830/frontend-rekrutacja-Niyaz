## Development Steps

### Step 1: Project Setup & Product List Component
- Initialize the project with the required dependencies and folder structure.
- Create a static list of 5–10 products with basic information (e.g., name, price, image).
- Implement a Product List component to display all products.

### Step 2: Product Details & Responsive Layout
- Develop a Product Details component to show detailed information about a selected product.
- Implement responsive layout logic:
  - On large screens (≥768px): Display the product list in the left column and the product details in the right column.
  - On small screens (<768px): Show only the product details card with a “Wróć do listy” (Back to list) button.

### Step 3: Interactivity & Final Touches
- Add interactivity: clicking a product opens its details.
- Implement the “Wróć do listy” button functionality for small screens.
- Polish UI/UX, test responsiveness, and ensure accessibility and code quality.
